The present study aimed to identify subtype-specific gene–miRNA regulatory networks
in invasive breast cancer through computational and integrative multi-omics approaches.
For this purpose, mRNA and miRNA expression data from different breast cancer subtypes, 
along with a clinical dataset were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Data origin: Comprehensive molecular portraits of human breast tumours.
